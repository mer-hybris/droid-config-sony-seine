            The purpose of this file is to disable known-broken codec
            configurations for CTS compatibility.

            The enabled="false" flag doesn't behave as expected for OMX, so
            disable the unsupported/broken codecs by specifying a non existing
            mime type. The later actual hw definition of the codec does NOT
            contain update="true" thus won't override the type, and even if
            there is an update="true" entry later it won't override the type
            either, see
            "MediaCodec: cannot update non-existing type for codec"
            in frameworks/av/media/libstagefright/xmlparser/MediaCodecsXmlParser.cpp.
            Thus as long as the two following definitions are the first ones
            being parsed, the codecs are disabled.
        -->
        <MediaCodec name="OMX.qcom.video.decoder.mpeg2" type="alien/disabled" enabled="false" />
        <MediaCodec name="OMX.qcom.video.decoder.mpeg2.secure" type="alien/disabled" enabled="false" />
    </Decoders>
